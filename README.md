# SSE-Part2
Part 2:Before doing this Assignment, I will first check whether the links of repositories and the fixing commits of theassigned vulnerabilities are valid. I will also have a close look at the tutorial about Git in Working Session 1, and also recall the knowledge I have gained about Git when doing Assignment1. If I did not install Git,  I  would  do  it.  Then,  I  will  start  to  clone/download  all  repositories  to  my computer.  After  that,  I  will  move  on  to  study  each  of  the  Git  command mentioned  in  the  Hints  of  task  3and  task  5to  find  out  which  parameter  it accepts and which one suits my need. I will need to repeat the same process for  every  (up  to  the 2most  relevant)  affected file  of fixing  commit  of  the vulnerability. For task 3, I will need to consider deleted (-) and added (+) lines separately. For deleted lines, I will use git blame I have studied earlier to find the  latest  commit  that  modified  such  lines.  For  added  lines, I  will  find  the closest enclosing scope as described as well as use any other code snippet that can lead to such addition. I will then utilize git blame to find the latest commits of all those relevant lines. For task4, I will learn about the listed parameters to see   and   explain   how   they   are   different   from   the   default   settings   (no parameters)  of  git  blame.  After  that,  I  will  run  each  of  them  to  see  whether they produce different VCCs for me. In case they give me different VCCs, and I will explain which oneI think give me the most satisfactory results.For task6, I  will  focus  on  the  fixing  commit  and  its  VCC(s)  using  git  log  and  git  show  to answer each question. For point d of task 6, I will try to look for the important keywords/phrases  that  I  have  observed  that  they  usually  go  together  with  a vulnerability/bug or  special  request  to  identify  the  special  events  that  might have higher priority and resulted in a delay in the fix.Then, I will describe and explain each taskin the report. I also fill in the Excel file the information I found. Finally, I will submit the 2 files to Canvas.
